                    Sometimes it’s the little ideas which promise great success! When a small group who are studying in IIT started the assignment DRAO single-handedly in 2022, even they never imagined that it would be such a success story. 
                    Over the past weeks, the small group from IIT has developed into a national company, considered to be the largest mail-order company for school and club sports in Sri Lanka. 
                    Since the very beginning, DRAO has focused on quality, a customer-oriented approach and product utility.
                    Despite our rapid expansion over the past few days, we have always remained a strong team and a committed family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We look forward to an active future with you: our team is here for you – wholeheartedly!
